## <a id="introduction">Introduction</a>

Run `npm i` to install all dependencies already declared in the package.json file. Ensure that you are utilizing the proper database by opening your integrated terminal and entering `mysql -u root -p`, entering your password, and inputting `use employees`. Then just `node index.js` to begin the inqurer and build your team!
